   <p>HTML5.tx is a place for designers and developers of all disciplines and backgrounds to learn from web experts and each other about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the future of the web.

      <h2>Event Information</h2>
      <p>HTML5.tx will feature a great line-up of speakers, workshops, social events, and people from most of the web technologies out there. You don't want to miss it.</p>
      <p>The conference will be Saturday, February 2nd, 2013, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at St. Edward's Ragsdale Center and will cost $99. Sessions will be offered in both &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Digging Deeper&quot; tracks. We'll also  bring back last year's popular Open Spaces sessions, so if group discussion is more your style, we'll have plenty of that, too! Regardless of your comfort with the web, you'll find content just right for you.</p>
      <p>For 2013, we're excited to offer, in addition to the conference, in-depth CSS and JavaScript workshops from industry experts <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/pamelafox/">Pamela Fox</a> and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/estellevw/">Estelle Weyl</a>. When you purchase tickets, you can choose just the Saturday conference, one or both of the workshops&mdash;or any combination of the three.</p>

      <h2><a id="hacky-hour">Hacky Hour</a></h2>
      <p>Picture it: It's Saturday evening, at the conclusion of an exhilarating day of learning about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Your brain is crackling with all the new concepts you want to try out. You're not ready for the conference to be over!</p>
      <p>And why should it be? Join us at Capital Factory for food, beverages, conversation, and code. More than a happy hour, we're hosting a Hacky Hour. Enjoy dinner and refreshments with your fellow conference attendees and keep the conversation going. If you feel inspired to bust out your laptop to share something you learned that day, that's cool, too; we'll have tables and wi-fi in Capital Factory's inspiring workspace.</p>
      <p>As a matter of fact, we've asked our conference speakers to extend their generosity and offer fun challenges to take the next step, building on what you learned in their sessions. It's a great way share your passion for the web with folks who get where you're coming from.</p>
      <p>After the conference closing remarks at the St. Edward's Ragsdale Center, head over to Capital Factory and join us!</p>

         <h2><a id="capital-factory">Getting to Capital Factory</a></h2>
         <p>Capital Factory is a co-working space on the 16th floor of the building that houses the Omni Hotel. You might want to <a href="http://www.capmetro.org/metrorail.aspx?id=312">take the MetroRail train to the Downtown station</a> or use the <a href="http://www.capmetro.org/planner/">CapMetro trip planner to find a convenient bus</a>.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, you'll want to travel from the conference at St. Edward's University to the party at Capital Factory. Two bus lines make that a convenient trip: 1L and 1M. The bus costs $1 each way, they run until midnight on Saturday, and they solve the question of parking downtown.</p>
