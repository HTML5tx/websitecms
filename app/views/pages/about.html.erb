   <h2>About</h2>
   <p>HTML5.tx is the premier event for web designers, developers and technologists in Texas. Our <a href="http://2011.html5tx.com">inaugural event</a> was held in Austin in 2011, and the second edition is slated for Feb 2nd, 2013. Check out the <a href="https://vimeo.com/36094284">promo video</a> for a recap of last year's event, and to get a preview of what's in store for 2013.</p>
   <p>The event is a place for people of all disciplines and backgrounds to learn from web experts and each other about HTML, CSS, JavaScript and the future of the web. And we mean ALL disciplines and backgrounds. Developers and designers are welcome. Love your browser of choice like a member of your family? Come tell us why. No matter what you do or who you are, if you love the web, you can expect to be surrounded with some of the best web-heads in Texas and beyond.</p>

      <h2>Event Information</h2>
      <p>HTML5.tx will feature a great line-up of speakers, social events the night before and after the event, and people from most of the web technologies out there. You don't want to miss it.</p>
      <p>The event itself will be held on Saturday, February 2nd, 2013 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at St. Edward's Ragsdale Center and will cost $99. Sessions will be offered in both &quot;Getting Started&quot; and &quot;Digging Deeper&quot; tracks. We'll also be bringing back last year's popular Open Spaces sessions, so if group discussion is more your style, we'll have plenty of that, too! Regardless of your comfort with the web, you'll find content just right for you.</p>
      <p>For 2013, we're excited to offer, in addition to the conference, in-depth CSS and JavaScript workshops from industry experts <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/pamelafox/">Pamela Fox</a> and <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/estellevw/">Estelle Weyl</a>. When you purchase tickets, you can choose just the Saturday conference, one or both of the workshops&mdash;or any combination of the three.</p>
